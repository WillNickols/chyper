    abstract = {Digital building representations enable and promote new forms of simulation, automation, and information sharing. However, creating and maintaining these representations is prohibitively expensive. In an effort to make the adoption of this technology easier, researchers have been automating the digital modeling of existing buildings by applying reality capture devices and computer vision algorithms. This article is a summary of the efforts of the past ten years, with a particular focus on object recognition methods. We rectify three limitations of existing review articles by describing the general structure and variations of object recognition systems and performing an extensive and quantitative comparative performance evaluation. The coverage of building component classes (i.e. semantic coverage) and recognition performances are reported in-depth and framed using a building taxonomy. Research programs demonstrate sparse semantic coverage with a clear bias towards recognizing floor, wall, ceiling, door, and window classes. Comprehensive semantic coverage of building infrastructure will require a radical scaling and diversification of efforts.}

	abstract = {Accurate microbial identification and abundance estimation are crucial for metagenomics analysis. Various methods for classification of metagenomic data and estimation of taxonomic profiles, broadly referred to as metagenomic profilers, have been developed. Nevertheless, benchmarking of metagenomic profilers remains challenging because some tools are designed to report relative sequence abundance while others report relative taxonomic abundance. Here we show how misleading conclusions can be drawn by neglecting this distinction between relative abundance types when benchmarking metagenomic profilers. Moreover, we show compelling evidence that interchanging sequence abundance and taxonomic abundance will influence both per-sample summary statistics and cross-sample comparisons. We suggest that the microbiome research community pay attention to potentially misleading biological conclusions arising from this issue when benchmarking metagenomic profilers, by carefully considering the type of abundance data that were analyzed and interpreted and clearly stating the strategy used for metagenomic profiling.},
